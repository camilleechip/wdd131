			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>I enjoy playing cozy video games in my free time. I like to relax
				and have a stress free time so I am making a blog about the best 
				cozy/farm sim games that are available on Steam.
			</p>
			

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience is primarily adults who enjoy playing cozy games, but
				are not sure which ones are worth the time and money. 
			</p>
			

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I am going to use an array to cycle through the available video games
				on the site. I also like the idea of a dark and light website so I will
				be adding that as well as buttons that will take the users to different 
				pages.
			</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#6F4133]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#EDB4E0]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#BFF2B1]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#EAE4D1]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

			</nav>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p> I am adding an image of Happy Home Paradise DLC for the video game Animal crossing 
				with the title and a short review to give people an idea of what is to be expected on this site. I am
				adding the logo at the top as well as a dark/light button and a button that
				takes the users directly to the child page with all the reviews. The footer 
				will container links to social media.

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>

				There is not a navigation link but it is clear that the second 
				page can be accessed down below with the "See All Reviews" button.
			</p>

			<!-- https://wireframe.cc/oKaI9C -->

			<h3>Reviews</h3>

				This page includes the image, platform and a review of each video game.
				It will also include prices and a summary of what to expect from each game.
